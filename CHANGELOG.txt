$Id$

July 21, 2006

July 21, 2006

July 13, 2006
Lots of changes!
- added timezone support - thanks Paulo
- added smiley support - thanks Paulo (sorry I hacked it up so much)
- added some theme support - thanks Paulo
- integrated some nice UI improvements - thanks Paulo
- moved online list for a chat to a Drupal block
- added an admin editable description blurb

July 2, 2006
- added first hacky implementation of '/msg' and '/me'. code is not
  the cleanest and UI could do with some work. usage:

  /msg <username> <msg text>
  the following message will show up in <user_name>'s chat only:
  [<time>] <sending_username> private: <msg text>

  /me <msg text>
  will show up italicised in all users chats:
  * <username> <msg text>

July 1, 2006
- added input filter widget to chatroom form
  http://drupal.org/node/71658 - thanks jason

June 30, 2006
- changed code again, sending module path and chatroom cache file
  to brower, so can avoid session bootstrap on cache hit again
- applied changes to make a query compatible with mysql 3.23 - thanks pacheco
  http://drupal.org/node/70949
- probably wont do much more until i've got the port to jQuery done

June 29, 2006
- applied fix from drupal user groovy - thanks!
  http://drupal.org/node/71247 - chat names not displaying in block
- changed chatroomread.php, which now does a drupal database bootstrap
  even for cache hits, because we need to get the path to the chatroom
  module file
- more path fixes, this time for this issue:
  http://drupal.org/node/71226 - thanks again groovy!

June 28, 2006
- speed ups: write messages use chatroomread.php, and no ajax operations 
  incur more than a drupal session bootstrap. might be time to change the
  this code will eat your computer warnings :-)

June 27, 2006
- applied changes to sql query as suggested by jun. thanks again!
  http://drupal.org/node/70771
