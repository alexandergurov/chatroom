First, I'm keen to give other developers control over this project.

I don't intend to maintain this as a one-person show, so if you can
show me that you're interested in this module and willing to put some
work in, then your say and your code will count.

1. Postgres support
There is none at the moment, and its the first thing on this list because I
see it as the most important thing to add.

2. Better UI for the chat screen
I'm not a CSS or UI guru, so anyone with lots of skill in these areas is
welcome to send suggestions, patches, etc. It would be nice to have
smileys, for example.

3. Integration with other Drupal modules
I'd like for chatroom's to be easily integrated into as many other cool
Drupal modules as possible. If you maintain a module and have an idea
or suggestion, let me know!

4. Code comments and documentation
Enough said.

5. Benchmarking
I'd like to write some scripts to benchmark the chatroom. The main
focus should be making the read operations cached (DONE), and faster
when there's a cache miss. I suspect that it may be worth sidestepping 
a full drupal bootstrap and doing just a db or session bootstrap, 
then modifying the module code such that the read msgs part doesn't
use anything that relys on a full bootstrap.

6. Check out the phpfreechat module
This may include helping them port to 4.7. There's likely a lot to learn
from this, and I'm not convinced yet whether phpfreechat can't achieve
what I wanted to achieve with this module.
