First, I'm keen to give other developers control over this project.

I don't intend to maintain this as a one-person show, so if you can
show me that you're interested in this module and willing to put some
work in, then your say and your code will count.

1. Postgres support
There is none at the moment, and its the first thing on this list because I
see it as the most important thing to add.

2. Better UI for the chat screen
I'm not a CSS or UI guru, so anyone with lots of skill in these areas is
welcome to send suggestions, patches, etc.

3. Integration with other Drupal modules
I'd like for chatroom's to be easily integrated into as many other cool
Drupal modules as possible. If you maintain a module and have an idea
or suggestion, let me know!
