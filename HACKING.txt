Chatroom module hacking notes
-----------------------------

1. Chats should be nodes.

2. All simple read operations should hit chatroomread.php, and be as light as possible for cache misses.
- a separate, very lightweight access check will be performed here

3. All other operations should hit Drupal's standard menu system.
- write a chat message
- ban or kick a user
- archive a chat
- any '/command' requests

4. Commands should be hookable, so that other modules can define commands and get control of the request
   if the command they define is fired.

5. The chat interface should work in a popup.

6. The adhoc chats (1 - 1, or many people) should not require a chatroom.

7. Adhoc chats and chats in chatrooms should be able to use an invite system.
