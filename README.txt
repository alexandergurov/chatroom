The chatroom module allows users to talk together in real time. Users enter
chat rooms which can have multiple chats. Permissions can be set to
restrict who can access, edit, and create chats and chat rooms.

The following commands can be used by administrators while they are in a
chat:

/kick (username) - The user will be kicked from the chat and be redirected
to a message page (message is configurable). The other users in the chat
will just see that the user has left the chat. The kicked user can enter
the chat again.

/ban (username) - Users can be banned from either specific chats or from
using any chatroom. [Needs documentation. How are they unbanned?]

The following commands can be used by all users while they are in a chat:

/invite (username) - [Needs documentation. This command doesn't seem to
work. I type in /invite (username) and it just displays those words on the
screen and doesn't seem to invite the test user.]

/block (username) - [Not completed yet.]
