CHATROOM MODULE
---------------
$Id$

This module enables chatrooms to be set up in Drupal 4.7 sites.

As at Jun 25, 2006, this is alpha code, not reviewed by anyone
in the Drupal community, so expect changes and expect BUGS.

Also, although a caching mechanism is in place, this code may
eat your server - DON'T use this on a machine you care about
without testing it first, as it can generate a lot of requests
in a short period of time.

Please read the TODO.txt file for info on what my immediate plans are.

Please, send bug reports, feature requests, or other comments to me:
