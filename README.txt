CHATROOM MODULE
---------------
$Id$

This module enables chatrooms to be set up in Drupal 4.7 sites.

As July 13, 2006, alpha code - still lots of development.
It seems to work ok, but expect changes and new features,
so expect BUGS.

Also, although a caching mechanism is in place, this code may
eat your server - DON'T use this on a machine you care about
without testing it first, as it can generate a lot of requests
in a short period of time.

Please read visit: 

http://drupal.org/project/issues/chatroom to

see where things are at.

Please, send bug reports, feature requests, or other comments to me:
