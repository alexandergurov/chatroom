Drupal 4.7

Support for special characters is only available if you are using MySQL 4.1

INSTALLATION
------------

1. DOWNLOAD CHATROOM

   Unpack the chatroom module in your modules directory.

2. CREATE THE DRUPAL DATABASE

   Enable the module in the administer->modules screen.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

By default, chatrooms are not accessable, so enable access for the roles
you want to be able to use chatrooms in the administer->access control.

If you want smileys support, you must install the smileys module and enable
smileys in the chat room configuration.
