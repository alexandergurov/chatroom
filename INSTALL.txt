1. Unpack the chatroom module in your modules directory.

2. Create a directory called 'chat_cache' in the your Drupal site temp 
directory, and make sure it is writable by your webserver. You can
find the value for your site in admin->settings.

3. Copy the chatroomread.php file from the chatroom directory into the base
Drupal install directory. It should sit next to the Drupal index.php file.

4. Enable the module in the administer->modules screen.

5. By default, chatrooms are not accessable, so enable it for the roles
you want to be able to use chatrooms in the administer->access control
