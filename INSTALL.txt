1. Unpack the chatroom module in your modules directory.

2. Change the ownership of the chat_cache directory so it is writable by
your webserver. 

3. Copy the chatroomread.php file from the chatroom directory into the base
Drupal install directory. It should sit next to the Drupal index.php file.

4. Enable the module in the administer->modules screen.

5. By default, chatrooms are not accessable, so enable it for the roles
you want to be able to use chatrooms in the administer->access control
